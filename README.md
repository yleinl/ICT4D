## How to Run the Django Project
1. Make sure you have Python and Django installed.
2. Use a virtual environment to manage the project dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment with the following commands:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

3. Install dependencies in the project root directory:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Modify the view functions in `weather_project/weather/views.py` to suit your requirements, and modify the template files as needed.
5. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
